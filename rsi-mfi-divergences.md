# RSI + MFI Divergence Indicator Strategy

## Overview
This indicator combines the **Relative Strength Index (RSI)** and the **Money Flow Index (MFI)** to identify momentum and volume-based divergences. It is designed to help traders detect potential reversal zones or continuation patterns by comparing price action with momentum and money flow behavior.

## Indicators Explained

### Relative Strength Index (RSI)
- Measures momentum by comparing average gains and losses over a specific period (commonly 14 periods).
- RSI ranges from 0 to 100.
  - Overbought: RSI > 70
  - Oversold: RSI < 30

### Money Flow Index (MFI)
- Similar to RSI but includes volume, making it a volume-weighted momentum indicator.
- MFI also ranges from 0 to 100.
  - Overbought: MFI > 80
  - Oversold: MFI < 20

## How to Use the Indicator

### Step 1: Look for Price vs RSI/MFI Divergences
- **Bullish Divergence**: Price makes a lower low, but RSI and/or MFI make higher lows. This can indicate waning selling pressure and a potential reversal to the upside.
- **Bearish Divergence**: Price makes a higher high, but RSI and/or MFI make lower highs. This suggests weakening buying pressure and possible reversal downward.

### Step 2: Look for RSI vs MFI Divergences
- If RSI and MFI are diverging from each other (e.g., RSI making higher highs but MFI making lower highs), it can signal internal weakness in the trend.
  - **RSI > MFI**: Momentum strong, but money flow may be weakening.
  - **MFI > RSI**: Strong inflow of capital despite weak momentum; may be a sign of accumulation.

### Step 3: Use in Confluence with Price Action
- Confirm divergences near key **Support/Resistance** levels or trendlines.
- Combine with **candlestick patterns** (e.g., engulfing, pin bars) or **volume spikes** for stronger confirmation.

### Step 4: Use Multiple Timeframes
- Higher timeframe divergences (e.g., 1D, 1W) provide stronger signals.
- Use lower timeframes (e.g., 4H, 1H) to fine-tune entries.

## Example Strategy Flow
1. Scan for assets near key horizontal support/resistance zones.
2. Check for divergences in price vs RSI and/or MFI.
3. Validate if RSI and MFI are diverging from each other.
4. Look for confirmation with candlestick or volume patterns.
5. Enter trade with proper risk management (stop-loss and target).

## Notes
- Divergences are early signals; not all lead to reversals. Always wait for price confirmation.
- Best used in ranging markets or at potential exhaustion zones of trends.

## Risk Management
- Do not rely on indicators alone.
- Use stop-loss orders and calculate position sizing based on risk-to-reward ratio.
